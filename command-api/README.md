# Bank Account Command API

![Github Actions Status](https://github.com/joseeliaschavez/bank-account-command-api/actions/workflows/gradle.yml/badge.svg?branch=develop&event=push)

An example SpringBoot microservice showcasing the CQRS and Event Sourcing architecture patterns.
This API accepts mutation events for mythical user bank accounts.

## Getting Started

### Kafka

The external Kafka service is defined as a standalone service in the `docker-compose.yml` file. Previously you had to 
also define a dependency on Zookeeper; the latest image can run independent with its own controller. 
See this [documentation](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/kafka) for more details.
